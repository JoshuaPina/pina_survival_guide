# Pina's Declassified PCI Survival Guide
#### *(Inspired by , but not affiliated with Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide)* 

###### Welcome to **pina_survival_guide**, a modular, data-driven project management tracker and survival system built by and for professionals running PCI (Public Contracting Institute) training programs. This is my new control tower.

## Project Goals

- Centralize event planning, instructor communication, and content prep
- Modularize core program management workflows using Jupyter Notebooks + CSVs
- Track tasks daily, weekly, monthly with context and accountability
- Analyze trends (burnout risk, task lag, instructor ratings, instructor delays, etc.)
- Lay the foundation for a Streamlit public-facing tool

I eventually hope to enable an admin level chatbot to help with reminders, and a customer-facing chatbot to help with FAQ and website directory.
